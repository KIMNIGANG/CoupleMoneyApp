# CoupleMoneyApp

I used ReactNative and Firebase to make this App

This App is for couple to do dutch treat. 
There is a Turn and it increase every 100000YEN.
So when A's turn is 12 and B's turn is 11 than B should have to pay 100000YEN to get to turn 12. 
Like this A and B don't have to think who paid more and who didn't paid. 

Sorry for my poor English
